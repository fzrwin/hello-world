First exercise with github to become acquainted

My name is Erwin, I used to learn some programming during my university mechinal engineering (20 years ago). At that time I wasnt much attracted to programming, only lately I feel interested to learn more about this. I just finished a basic python course, and now want to see what gfithub has to offer and how it works. 

Cheers!!
